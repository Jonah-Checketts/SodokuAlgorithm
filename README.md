# SodokuAlgorithm
I am working on making an algorithm that solves a sudoku board.
I am using Tkinter for the GUI this is a default package in python so you don't need to download anything external to use it
The algorithm I am using to solve this will kindof brute force the sodoku board until It gets all of the right squares
I don't know exactly how I am going to set up the algorithm yet but I will explain it in more detail in future editions
